Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to uncover insights and patterns that help understand the factors influencing passenger survival rates.

Dataset Overview
Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning

Handle missing values:

Replace missing Age values with the median.

Replace missing Embarked values with the mode.

Drop the Cabin column due to excessive missing values.

Encode categorical variables:

Convert Sex and Embarked to numerical formats.

Remove duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize data distributions (e.g., age, fare).

Analyze survival rates based on:

Gender.

Passenger class.

Combined gender and class.

Generate a correlation heatmap to identify relationships between variables.

3. Insights & Conclusions

Gender: Females had higher survival rates compared to males.

Passenger Class: First-class passengers had the best survival odds, while third-class had the worst.

Fare: Higher fares correlated positively with survival chances.

Age: Younger passengers showed slightly better survival probabilities.
Tools Used

Python Libraries used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
